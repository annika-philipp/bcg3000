# bcg3000 - Personal Project (week 4 - 6) as part of Enspiral Dev Academy web development course

bcg3000 is a questions/answer game based on our experience as students of EDA. At the time of writing this game, this was by far the most challenging project I had taken on (while also studying 70 hrs/week).

* Written with React, Knex.js, Express.js, Node.js 

* This is the first version of my game and has become a training ground for experimenting with new software. bcg-redux is the same game but re-written with react/redux. I am currently working on both a ruby version as well a react-native version.
